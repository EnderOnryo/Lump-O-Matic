A mod that allows you to automate human viable lump scumming. 

Button 1 selects what Lump type you want the next lump to be.
Button 2 displays the current Lump type and selects how many lumps you wish to get from the currently growing lump.
Button 3 selects how many attempts will pass before it stops process. (If you select 0 it will run infinitely.)
Button 4 selects how much time will pass before it stops the process. (If you select 0 it will run infinitely.)
Button 5 activates the process.
Button 6 resets all settings back to their defaults.

When you activate the process it will harvest the lump, check the current lump type & how many lumps you got, if they do not match what you selected it will reload the save and try again.
While the process is running you will not be able to interact with the game, so if you don't want it running for an extended duration then it is advised to add a cutoff selection.
